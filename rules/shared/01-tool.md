# Tool Use

First move — NARROW THE SCOPE before calling. A tool aimed at "the module responsible for X" finds it; a tool aimed at "X" returns noise.

## Batching — #1 iter saver

Every serial repeat of the same tool wastes a full turn. Use array / multi form FIRST:

- `recall` / `search` / `explore` → `query` as ARRAY; internal agent fans out in parallel.
- `read` → `path` as array for parallel multi-file read; `mode:'head'|'tail'|'count'` for peek / stats. NEVER serial `read`.
- `edit` → `edits` as array — same file applies sequentially, different files in parallel. Covers old `multi_edit` / `batch_edit` in one call. NEVER serial `edit`.
- `apply_patch` → prefer for non-trivial multi-file or large-context edits. One patch turn beats repeated `read` → `edit` loops.
- `grep` → `pattern` and/or `glob` as array (OR-joined).
- `glob` → `pattern` as array (OR-joined).
- `bash` → chain dependent commands with `&&` / `;` in ONE call. NEVER split dependent work.
- `list` → single call; switch `mode:'list'|'tree'|'find'` for the view.
- Independent calls on DIFFERENT tools with no data dependency — send in ONE message, not sequential turns.

## General Iter Budget

- Work in **2 rounds max per sub-problem** (locate → confirm). Repeated retrieval → ask what NEW information the next call adds; enough evidence → stop probing and move to the edit / answer.

## Routing

**Information-retrieval tools are top priority. Always prefer `recall` / `search` / `explore` (and `read` / `glob` / `list` / `grep` for known-path / pattern work) over `bash` for any lookup. Using `bash` with `ls` / `cat` / `find` / `head` / `tail` / `grep` for file or code lookup is a rule violation — `bash` is shell-only work (git, build, test, run).**

- **Order when unsure: recall → search → explore → grep+read. This order is mandatory, not a suggestion. Skip a step only when you already know which tool the query belongs to.**
- Past context → `recall`. External web / URL / GitHub → `search`. Local filesystem → `explore`.
- Known path → `read` directly. Unknown location → `grep` / `glob` first, then targeted `read`.
- Code structure (imports, dependents, symbols, references, callers): `code_graph` before raw `grep`.
- In the main/public tool surface, prefer the direct aliases when available:
  `find_imports`, `find_dependents`, `find_references`, `find_callers`, `find_symbol`.
- For the main/public session, do not reach for generic `code_graph(mode=...)` if one direct alias exactly matches the question. The alias is the first choice.
- If you know an identifier / constant / function / class name but not the file, use `find_symbol` before `grep`.
- Multi-file or already-clear edits: `apply_patch` before repeated `read` → `edit`.
- Shell work across turns: `bash_session` reuses shell state — don't replay setup in repeated `bash` calls.
- For long background commands, prefer `job_wait` over repeated `job_status` polling.
- Large tool outputs may be saved to a path with a preview; only `read` that path if the preview is insufficient.
- `explore` — one natural-language query fans glob + grep out in parallel; ideal for multi-angle questions ("how does X work, and where is it configured?") where several patterns need to land in one shot.

## Decision Table

Use these rules regardless of the current role name. Role-specific prompts may add nuance, but the first tool choice should follow this table unless the user explicitly asks otherwise.

- "I know the identifier name, but not the file" → `find_symbol`
- "Who imports this file?" → `find_imports`
- "Who depends on this file?" → `find_dependents`
- "Who calls this symbol?" → `find_callers`
- "Where is this symbol referenced?" → `find_references`
- "Main/public session and the question is exactly imports / dependents / callers / references?" → direct alias FIRST, generic `code_graph` only if the question is broader.
- Broader structural graph question / impact / mixed graph query → `code_graph`
- "I know the file already" → `read`
- "I need 2+ known files" → one `read` call with array `path`
- "I need to create/replace several whole files" → `write_many`
- "I need broad text search / regex / config phrase lookup" → `grep`
- "I need file path discovery / filename patterns" → `glob`
- "I need quick directory shape / recent files / mtime clues" → `list`
- "I need external docs / GitHub / web" → `search`
- "I need prior project/session memory" → `recall`
- "I know the exact edit across multiple files" → `apply_patch`
- "I need a small local replacement in one file" → `edit`
- "I need shell state across turns" → `bash_session`
- "I launched a long-running command in background" → `job_wait`, then `job_read` only if needed

## Anti-patterns

- Do not call `find_symbol` and `grep` for the same identifier in the same round unless `find_symbol` returned no declaration candidate.
- Do not poll `job_status` repeatedly when `job_wait` would answer in one call.
- Do not serially `read` files one by one when the candidate list is already known.
- Do not serially `write` several whole files when `write_many` can do it in one call.
- Do not `read` a whole large file when `find_symbol`, `code_graph`, or `grep` can narrow the line window first.

## Scope boundaries

- `recall` — past context only. Not codebase, not web.
- `search` — external / web only. Not codebase, not memory.
- `explore` — local filesystem only. Not web, not memory.
- Pick the right tool; no silent cross-scope fan-out.

## Stop-and-reroute

Tool returns empty / wrong after 2 tries → don't loop. Change approach or ask.
